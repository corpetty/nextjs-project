## Functionality
- Implement BIP39, BIP32, and BIP44 standards for key derivation and wallet management
- Store historical value of tokens over their lifetime in the portfolio
- Support manual entry of addresses and selection of chains
- Automatically discover and save tokens (both fungible and NFT) from chosen addresses and chains
- Fetch and display current and historical values of known tokens
- Implement portfolio overview showing known tokens and their values
- Support manual grouping of addresses based on key management solutions
- Allow manual description of provenance for address groups
- Integrate with service APIs for token value information

## Usability
- Map `addresses` to `tokens` based on user-chosen `chains`
- Specify `value` of `tokens` in a chosen base currency (default to USD)
- Provide clear understanding of `key management` for each `private key` associated with each `address`
- Detail mechanisms of provenance for `portfolio`
- Implement intuitive dashboard views:
  - Portfolio view: Overall value, distribution, and historical performance
  - Access view: Mechanisms of access to the entire portfolio
  - Provenance view: How the portfolio gets passed on under user-set criteria
- Support manual grouping of addresses based on key management solutions:
  - Seed phrase (hardware wallet, mobile wallet, desktop/browser wallet, multisig)
  - Keystore
  - Private key

## Reliability
- Ensure accurate and up-to-date token discovery and valuation
- Implement robust error handling for API integrations and data fetching
- Provide fallback mechanisms for token valuation in case of API failures

## Performance
- Optimize data fetching and caching strategies for quick loading of portfolio information
- Implement efficient algorithms for historical data analysis and visualization
- Ensure responsive UI even with large portfolios

## Supportability
- Maintain clear documentation of all major functions and components
- Document API endpoints and data models
- Keep codebase modular for easy updates and maintenance
- Implement comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Plan for future enhancements:
  - Activity alerts
  - Dead man switches
